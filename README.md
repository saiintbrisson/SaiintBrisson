## hey there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Luiz (he/him), 17 years old, programming enthusiast and hobbyist photographer.  

### Interests

I'm always learning something new! Looking forward to working with Rust ðŸ¦€ professionally, my all-time favorite language (subject to change, of course). I enjoy building servers, implementing protocols, messing with sockets, and designing systems. 

My main interests are networks, distributed systems, and DevOps. Being a very curious person, I like to understand how fast & reliable services are designed and work, thus, researching a lot and studying most of my time, reading whitepapers, articles (_sometimes of dubious quality_), open-source codebases, etc. I'm also an open-source movement enthusiast.
