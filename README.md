## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Luiz (he/him), a self-taught developer and hobbyist photographer. Most of my spare time is allocated to reading and researching, I'm a really curious person!

My interests are microkernels, distributed systems, and Rust, which has been my favorite language to work with for the last year or so. Although I have little knowledge about most stuff, I've played around with lots of cool tech in the past, from Kubernetes, to Kafka, to TiKV, and so on. And I'm eager to learn more!

I also like connecting to new people, so feel free to hmu :)
