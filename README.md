## hey there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Luiz (he/him), 18 years old, programming enthusiast and hobbyist photographer.  

### A brief introduction

I'm always learning something new! Looking forward to working with Rust ðŸ¦€ professionally, my all-time favorite language (subject to change, of course). I get entertained with servers, network protocols, system architectures, and OS development.

My main interests are networks, distributed systems (consensus algorithms fascinate me), DevOps, microkernels, and event-driven systems. Being a very curious person, I like to understand how fast & reliable services are designed and work, thus, researching a lot and studying most of my time, reading whitepapers, articles (_sometimes of dubious quality_), open-source codebases, etc. I'm also an open-source movement enthusiast.

#### Tech interests

* Languages: Rust, Kotlin, Go, and Haskell (also proficient in Java).
* Databases: TiDB (TiKV), Cassandra, Postgres, and Cockroach.
* Cloud: Mainly AWS and Red Hat products, but I'm interested in almost everything CNCF touches.
* DevOps: Container runtimes in general, K8s and the HashiCorp stack (Nomad, Consul, Vault, etc).

I also like event-driven systems and message queues (my favorties being Kafka and ZeroMQ).
