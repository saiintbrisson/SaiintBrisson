## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Luiz (he/him), a self-taught developer. You will find me studying all sorts of different networking subjects or contributing to many different projects, from eBPF tools (like BCC), to io-uring libraries. I like building things from scratch, that's how I learn.

I've implemented about a dozen load balancers, SSH servers, eBPF VMs, Bayer demosaic algorithms for my raws, the craziest orchestration mechanisms for Minecraft servers, lots of CRDT structures, and bootloaders and microkernels. As you can see, my interests are all very well defined.

I take pictures. And listen to music, all the time. But I don't play anything, be it instruments or games, I'm terrible in all of them. I also like connecting to new people, so feel free to hmu :)
